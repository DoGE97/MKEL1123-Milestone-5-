This repository contains the code for a small project.

## Introduction 

The aim of this project is to create a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based facial recognition that is made by using STM32F4 series development board. The image dataset is acquired from faces94 and 5 inviduals are selected for training the network using tensorflow framework. After the network is trained, the network is converted to lighter version to meet with the requirement of smaller or tiny devices. To display the results,  LCD .... is used ..... + more details
